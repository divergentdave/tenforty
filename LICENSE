Additional permission:

If you modify this Program, or any covered work, by linking or
combining it with clojure (or a modified version of that
library), containing parts covered by the terms of the Eclipse
Public License, the licensors of this Program grant you
additional permission to convey the resulting work. {Corresponding
Source for a non-source form of such a combination shall include the
source code for the parts of clojure used as well as that
of the covered work.}

Clarification:

An application hosted on a server and remotely operated by users, such
as a web application or database server, is understood to be distribution
of the software, and therefore all GPL v2 clauses regarding distribution
apply. For example, a web application must include a link for downloading
the application source code.
